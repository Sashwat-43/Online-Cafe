# Online-Cafe

This project is made to resolve the problems faced by the people belonging to the rural areas and also by the general public in this pandemic. Before the pandemic people used to go to the offline cafes for filling the important forms , for eg. filling up the application form some competitive examinations like JEE , UPSC and list goes on and on. They did not just filled the form for some examinations but also for applying for some important documents like Adhaar Card , Pan Card , Driving license, etc. which would not be possible for them to fill by their own at their remote locations.

So we have created an efficient online variant to this offline process. We have created a website in which customer can signup with his/her credentials and then he/she can connect to all the available (online) authors on a real time chat box built by us and then the customer can send the required and relevant documents for filling up the associated form to the author. The author will send a preview of the form filled to the customer and then after the customer pays the author through our secure and reliable payment gateway the form will be finally submitted and the payment will be recieved and the documents will be deleted from the author's side. For the authenticity of the author we have the important details of the author like his address, adhaar number , contact information ,etc. in our database.

After the process is completed the customer will get a feedback page in which he/she can rate the process from 1 to 5 stars.
